review:
  en: Zin cafe is the prime spot for digital nomads. There are plugs on most of the seats upstairs, you can order food and drinks via the QR code and they are all delicious. You could simpluy use them as a restaurant after a day on the beach, or you could stay there foreever and work. WiFi is just a bit slow but definitely workable.
