review:
  en: A cafe with very fast wifi in Kuta. Power plugs are available in most of the wall sided seats, and music ins't too loud. Drinks and foods aren't too expensive, compared to similar spots in Sminyak or Canggu. There are air conditions seats inside, but also you can sit on the terrace seats.
