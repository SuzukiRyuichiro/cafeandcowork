review:
  en: A cafe / restaurants very popular amongst the tourists around the area. There aren't any plugs and it seems that people come here for brunch or coffee. Not many working people. The wifi is trash in the conservatory area so you have to sit on the main cafe area to get some reception. It was quiet in the morning but as people start to come for breakfast and brunch, it was so noisy that I couldn't hear a thing with my on ear headset with max volume.
