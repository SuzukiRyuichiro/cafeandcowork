Located in the Tokyo International Forum atrium. It's on B1 but plenty of natural light from the atrium windows. The nearest subway exit is D5. There's an indoor seating area as well as a seating area in the atrium. The atrium isn't open to the outside, but it was still a bit chilly during winter time. Very fast WiFi (Doutour Free WiFi) and the large worktable has power outlets.
