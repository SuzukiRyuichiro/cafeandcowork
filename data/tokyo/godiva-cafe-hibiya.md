A surprisingly good cafe to work from in Hibiya. The cafe is located on the 2nd floor of the TOHO Hibiya Promenade building. There are counter seats along the windows with nice views. There are plenty of things to order on the menu, including regular tea and coffee. The chocolate/truffle set is a nice option! Decent WiFi and power outlets. Restrooms are not in the cafe, but are located a short walk away from the cafe on the same floor.
