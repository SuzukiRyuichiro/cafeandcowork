A combined Cinnabon and Seattle's Best Coffee. Located right in front of the 1b exit at Roppongi station. The second floor is large and spacious. Use the "free_seattles" WiFi network, which is very fast (password located by the dish return area). You can definitely smell Cinnabon upstairs, but the smell isn't too overpowering.
