There's a small cafe at the Impact Hub building. The cafe is open to the public and you don't need a membership. It's a nice, quiet spot to work, but the guest WiFi is extremely slow and the power outlets are blocked. The cafe serves drinks and some small food/snacks. Food is only available between 11:30 and 14:00.
