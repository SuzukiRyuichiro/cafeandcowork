A nice spot to grab a drink and get some work done. WiFi works well on the first floor, but wasn't really usable on the second floor. Staff was friendly and speaks good english. Update: They fixed the WiFi issue upstairs and now there is a reliable 120 to 180 Mbps download WiFi even during the peak hours.
