Easily one of the best places to work from in Tokyo. It's free to use, all you need is an AWS account to register. Plenty of comfortable seats, fast WiFi, lots of power outlets, and amazing views. There's a small cafe selling drinks and snacks, as well as a vending machine. It can get busy so be sure to arrive early to grab a seat.

**Access**: 
1. From the street, take the escalator up to the 3rd floor, following the signs to the office. AWS Loft guests can bypass reception, and proceed straight to the elevators by then following the signs for AWS Loft.
2. Tell the guard at the elevators that you're going to AWS Loft, they will let you through the gate without a badge.
3. In the elevator, proceed to the 17th floor where you will reach a reception area. Entering the space requires ID verification, such as by scanning a QR code from [your registered account on the mobile website](https://aws-startup-lofts.com), and then presenting a business card or ID/passport to confirm a match.
5. You will be given a lanyard to wear with your name, which you are expected to return upon your departure.

**Signup**: You'll need to [register on their website](https://aws-startup-lofts.com) before entering.

**Space**: The space looks really impressive with large windows offering amazing views of the surrounding area. There are different zones for working, relaxing, and meetings. There is also an "ask an AWS expert" corner, which is a fun concept. Lots of power outlets. There is music playing.

**Seating**: There are large shared work tables with soft and hard chairs. The soft chairs are really comfortable actually. There's also counter-style seating along the back wall, and couch-style seating along another wall. It can fill up quickly so it is best to arrive early.

**Wifi**: Excellent. 100 Mbit down. 150 Mbit up. 6-18ms ping.

**Food/drinks**: There is a coffee/tea machine and soft drinks for purchase, and some snacks for purchase as well. I usually just grab a Starbucks from downstairs instead.

**Meeting rooms**: There are several meeting rooms and phone booths that (I think) can be booked for free as well. I haven't really looked into it yet, though.

**Overall**: A really cool space, comfortable work area, good location right by Meguro station. The main drawback is that the space is only open from 10:00-18:00 Mon - Wed.
