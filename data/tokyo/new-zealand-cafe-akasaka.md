A small coffee shop located in the area between Roppongi and Akasaka-Mitsuke. There is a row of counter seats along the windows, and one table to the side. Not particularly ergonomic, but decent for a quick drink and getting some work done. It was very quiet on a weekday afternoon. Keep in mind they close very early!
