Dotour isn't usually my first choice for working, but this location outside Kawasaki station is pretty nice though. There's a lot of seating inside, but I think the best choice is the tables by the windows overlooking the intersection below. Fast WiFI, power outlets at some tables, and not too crowded during the day time on a weekday.
