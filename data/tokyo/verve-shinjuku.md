A very small Verve, located just outside the Shinjuku station New South JR gates. There are some seats but it is usually pretty crowded all through the day. No power outlets, but you can access the Dean Deluca WiFi (no password required). No restrooms, but I'm sure you can find some public restrooms nearby.
