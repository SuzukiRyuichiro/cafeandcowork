Coworking space that is free and easy to sign up. You have to sign up and show the QR code techinically, but I was not asked. The space is full of tables and chairs. They seems to host events sometimes so should check the schedule in advance. You can pay up and use the restricted area with phone booth, but the free member area is decent enuogh. The only down side is that the coffee is tasteless, and there is a strict rule against taking phone calls.
