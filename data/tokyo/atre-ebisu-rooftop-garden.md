Located on top of the Ebisu Atre West building (the one with Shake Shack at the ground floor). There are elevators outside next to Shake Shack that go up to the 8th floor. There are quite a few tables that are free to use. Surprisingly the Atre WiFi is very fast.

I think the best time to use the space is either early morning or late afternoon, as you can get some shade and it will be less crowded. Since the space is shared with a restaurant, it can get a bit busy and noisy if there are large groups using the restaurant's outdoor space.

Restrooms are located one floor down, next to Din Tai Fung.
